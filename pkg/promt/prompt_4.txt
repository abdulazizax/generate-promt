Based on the project data, create a BPMN diagram in text form (no Markdown). 
Describe the key interaction steps in a clear, structured way so it fits nicely in a Google Doc. 
Focus on the sequence of actions from the clientâ€™s perspective to concluding the deal.

Steps to include (as headings or bullet points):
1) Client logs in
2) Client selects an object and starts a VR tour
3) Client submits a request and contacts a realtor
4) Client and realtor discuss terms
5) Deal is concluded

Structure it like:
BPMN MODEL
1) Login:
   - Explanation...
2) Selecting an Object / VR Tour:
   - Explanation...
3) Submitting a Request...
... etc.

Avoid using code blocks or Markdown. Just return a text-based outline that I can paste into Google Docs easily.
