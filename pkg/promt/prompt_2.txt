You have data about our project: its name, domain, features, and goals. From this data, please infer three likely competitor names operating in the same space. Then, produce a comparative analysis in JSON format only, with these requirements:

1. The JSON output is an array of objects.
2. Each object represents a single feature comparison, having:
   - "Feature": the feature name.
   - A field for our project, named exactly after the project's name (e.g., "MyProject").
   - A field for each of the three inferred competitors (e.g., "Competitor1", "Competitor2", "Competitor3"), using their actual names instead of "Competitor1" and so on.
3. Use "✓" if the project or competitor has that feature, or "✗" if not.
4. Do not output any explanations or text besides the raw JSON. No triple quotes or extra formatting.

For example, if you infer three competitors called "FastPay," "ClickX," and "Paymatic," and our project name is "MyPaymentSystem," your JSON might look like:

[
  {
    "Feature": "International Payments",
    "MyPaymentSystem": "✓",
    "FastPay": "✓",
    "ClickX": "✗",
    "Paymatic": "✓"
  },
  {
    "Feature": "Mobile Wallet Integration",
    "MyPaymentSystem": "✓",
    "FastPay": "✓",
    "ClickX": "✓",
    "Paymatic": "✗"
  }
]

Remember:
- You must guess appropriate competitor names from the project’s domain context.
- Return only the JSON array with no extra text or code blocks.
