Create a Site/App Map (a structural map of the project) in plain text. 
Organize it with headings or numbered sections for clarity, including:
- Functional modules (Registration, Home Page, etc.)
- User roles (Administrator, Client, etc.)
- Integrations (CRM, payment systems, etc.)

For example:

SITE/APP MAP
1) Functional Modules:
   - Registration: how it works, etc.
   - Home Page: ...
   - ...
2) User Roles:
   - Administrator: what they can do
   - Client: what they can do
3) Integrations:
   - CRM: ...
   - Payment systems: ...

Do not use Markdown or code blocks. Provide a straightforward text layout thatâ€™s easy to insert into Google Docs.
