Based on the provided functional list, estimate the approximate development timeline, team composition, and overall project cost. 
Take into account the fixed monthly salaries (in USD) for each role:

- Project Manager (PM): 2200
- Team Lead: 2400
- Backend Developer: 2200
- Frontend Developer: 2200
- UX/UI Designer: 2400
- QA Engineer: 2200
- DevOps Engineer: 2700

Determine:
1) How many months (months) and how many specialists (count) are needed for each role,
2) The total amount (sum) for each role (sum = months * monthlySalary * count),
3) The hours (hours), hourly rate (hourlyRate), and total cost (cost) for each module (for example, Backend, Frontend, Design, Testing, DevOps),
4) A financial plan (financialPlan) with the following fields:
   - "prepaymentPercent" (the prepayment percentage),
   - "prepayment" (the prepayment amount),
   - "monthlyPayments" — an array in which each element corresponds to the amount for a given month (e.g., [4000, 4500, 3700] if there are 3 months),
   - "totalProjectCost" — the total cost of the project.

Return the answer strictly in JSON format (without triple quotes or explanations). The structure should be:
- "team": an array of objects with the fields "role", "count", "months", "monthlySalary", "sum".
- "modules": an array of objects with the fields "moduleName", "hours", "hourlyRate", "cost".
- "financialPlan": an object with the fields
  "prepaymentPercent",
  "prepayment",
  "monthlyPayments" (an array of numbers),
  "totalProjectCost".

For example (the numbers may vary, but keep the same fields):

{
  "team": [
    {
      "role": "Project Manager (PM)",
      "count": 1,
      "months": 2,
      "monthlySalary": 2200,
      "sum": 4400
    },
    {
      "role": "Team Lead",
      "count": 1,
      "months": 2,
      "monthlySalary": 2400,
      "sum": 4800
    }
  ],
  "modules": [
    {
      "moduleName": "Backend",
      "hours": 400,
      "hourlyRate": 13.75,
      "cost": 5500
    },
    {
      "moduleName": "Frontend",
      "hours": 350,
      "hourlyRate": 13.75,
      "cost": 4812.5
    }
  ],
  "financialPlan": {
    "prepaymentPercent": 30,
    "prepayment": 5118.75,
    "monthlyPayments": [4881.25, 5062.50],
    "totalProjectCost": 17062.50
  }
}

Please return only JSON, without enclosing quotes or any additional text.
