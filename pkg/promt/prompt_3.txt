Create a logical infrastructure diagram for our project in text form (no Markdown). 
Structure your response so itâ€™s easy to read in a Google Doc. 

Use headings (like "Frontend", "Backend", "Database", "Integrations") or numbered sections to describe:
- The main components (Frontend, Backend, Database, Storage, etc.)
- How each component interacts with the others
- Any external integrations (APIs, third-party services)

Avoid using Markdown syntax for headings or lists. Instead, use clear text formatting such as:

INFRASTRUCTURE DIAGRAM (TITLE)
1) Frontend:
   - Explanation of what it does 
   - How it communicates with Backend

2) Backend:
   - Explanation of what it does
   - How it communicates with Database

... and so on.

Please keep the entire response purely in text, with headings and paragraphs that can be easily copied into Google Docs. Do not add code blocks or Markdown symbols.
